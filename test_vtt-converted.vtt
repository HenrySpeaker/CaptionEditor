WEBVTT

00:06.260 --> 00:07.759
Great job, Kristian.

00:11.560 --> 00:13.509
All right, we're going to
switch to our left,

00:14.520 --> 00:17.049
just left hook punches only.

00:20.060 --> 00:21.719
Great job, Marcela.

00:29.599 --> 00:31.943
All right, let's get a few more
in and then we're going to put

00:31.954 --> 00:33.068
them both together.

00:39.359 --> 00:41.019
All right, let's put them both
together.

00:41.089 --> 00:42.749
That's going to be a right and
a left.

00:46.720 --> 00:48.749
Great job transitioning, guys.

00:58.360 --> 00:59.509
Keep it up.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.119
Great job, everyone.

01:08.190 --> 01:09.049
Keep going.

01:20.400 --> 01:21.051
Don't stop.

01:21.106 --> 01:21.947
Don't think about it.

01:21.950 --> 01:23.559
Just keep throwing those
punches.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.317
All right, let's get ready to
put four of them together,

01:33.317 --> 01:34.110
everyone.

01:35.080 --> 01:35.899
So it's going to be

01:35.900 --> 01:36.269
1,

01:36.270 --> 01:36.759
2,

01:36.760 --> 01:37.209
3,

01:37.210 --> 01:37.779
4.

01:39.550 --> 01:41.339
Four quick hook punches.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.339
Great job, Marcela.

01:54.540 --> 01:57.289
All right, let's go for 30
seconds, let's finish it out.

02:10.800 --> 02:14.619
And remember, you want to reset
after you throw your punches.

02:15.040 --> 02:17.831
Hands back up, four punches.

02:17.976 --> 02:20.379
Hands up, four punches.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.415
All right, we got 10,

02:30.598 --> 02:31.423
9,

02:31.622 --> 02:32.369
GREAT!

02:32.760 --> 02:33.409
7,

02:33.840 --> 02:34.649
6,

02:34.940 --> 02:35.699
5----------

02:36.040 --> 02:36.949
4,

02:37.120 --> 02:37.959
3,

02:38.280 --> 02:39.079
2,

02:39.570 --> 02:41.139
and SPIRIT.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.203
All right, great job, everyone.

02:43.320 --> 02:46.163
Before I pass it along to
Marcella, we're going to jump

02:46.174 --> 02:49.043
right back into our shoulder
presses, and we're going to

02:49.054 --> 02:50.759
incorporate hook punches.

02:52.940 --> 02:56.919
Let's say five chest presses,
and then we're going to throw

02:56.919 --> 02:58.616
four hook punches.

02:58.648 --> 02:59.035
Okay?

02:59.160 --> 03:00.079
So 1,

03:00.080 --> 03:00.569
2,

03:00.570 --> 03:01.139
3,

03:01.150 --> 03:01.709
4,

03:01.710 --> 03:02.309
5----------

03:02.700 --> 03:03.229
1,

03:03.230 --> 03:03.619
2,

03:03.620 --> 03:04.069
3,

03:04.070 --> 03:04.599
4.

03:05.100 --> 03:05.699
1,

03:05.700 --> 03:06.129
2.

03:06.160 --> 03:06.639
3,

03:06.640 --> 03:07.139
4,

03:07.140 --> 03:07.759
5----------

03:08.090 --> 03:08.749
1,

03:08.890 --> 03:09.389
2,

03:09.390 --> 03:09.779
3,

03:09.780 --> 03:10.209
4.

03:10.466 --> 03:11.329
All right?

03:18.740 --> 03:19.791
Great job, everyone.

03:19.846 --> 03:20.769
Keep it up.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.095
Nice combination, Avery.

03:30.108 --> 03:31.249
Feeling it.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.169
All right, we got 10,

03:38.540 --> 03:39.289
9,

03:40.060 --> 03:40.855
GREAT!

03:41.040 --> 03:41.719
7,

03:42.070 --> 03:42.649
6,

03:43.160 --> 03:43.969
5----------

03:44.180 --> 03:44.909
4,

03:45.410 --> 03:46.209
3,

03:46.640 --> 03:47.449
2,

03:48.000 --> 03:49.499
and SPIRIT.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.869
Awesome job, everyone.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.687
Now I'll pass it along to
Marcella and see what she has up

03:55.698 --> 03:56.269
next.

03:56.800 --> 03:57.403
All right.

03:57.442 --> 03:58.423
Thank you, Avery.

03:58.552 --> 04:02.599
Okay, our next target movement
is going to be our jumping jacks.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.607
So I'm going to be doing the
standing version, which is I'm

04:05.618 --> 04:08.619
going to tap to the side, bring
my arms overhead

04:09.600 --> 04:10.829
right in the middle.

04:12.980 --> 04:15.264
If you're doing the advanced
version, you can follow along

04:15.264 --> 04:16.580
with Kristian.

04:21.030 --> 04:22.209
Nice.

04:25.720 --> 04:26.869
Nice work.

04:30.990 --> 04:32.269
Good job, Avery.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.459
Keep it going for 20 seconds.

04:52.960 --> 04:53.709
10,

04:54.160 --> 04:54.955
9,

04:55.138 --> 04:55.963
GREAT!

04:56.162 --> 04:56.909
7,

04:57.150 --> 04:57.819
6,

04:58.340 --> 04:59.099
5----------

04:59.380 --> 05:00.089
4,

05:00.360 --> 05:01.019
3,

05:01.550 --> 05:02.269
2,

05:02.810 --> 05:04.809
and SPIRIT.

05:05.010 --> 05:05.889
Awesome.

05:06.040 --> 05:06.869
All right,

05:08.440 --> 05:11.231
we're going to do our uppercut,
so we're going to start with

05:11.242 --> 05:12.979
the right uppercut.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.687
You're going to lean on the leg
that is in front of you and

05:16.698 --> 05:20.543
bring that uppercut all the way
through your hips.

05:20.672 --> 05:21.989
All the way through.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.469
So let's do it.

05:26.280 --> 05:27.349
Right uppercuts.

05:33.310 --> 05:34.149
Just like that.

05:34.150 --> 05:35.019
Very good.

05:52.700 --> 05:53.809
Good, Avery.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.999
Okay, let's do our left
uppercuts.

06:01.500 --> 06:02.399
Left.

06:09.400 --> 06:10.989
Good job, everyone.

06:15.710 --> 06:16.789
Keep it going.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.669
All right, let's do them
together.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.409
Right, left, right, left
uppercuts.

06:30.270 --> 06:31.519
All right, let's go.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.169
Right and left, good job.

06:48.740 --> 06:50.179
Good work, Avery.

06:56.140 --> 06:57.259
Excellent.

06:59.580 --> 07:02.119
Keep it going for 20 more
seconds.

07:12.640 --> 07:13.389
10,

07:13.700 --> 07:14.409
9,

07:14.730 --> 07:15.559
GREAT!

07:15.930 --> 07:16.669
7,

07:17.080 --> 07:17.939
6,

07:18.300 --> 07:18.959
5----------

07:19.530 --> 07:20.359
4,

07:20.700 --> 07:21.519
3,

07:22.260 --> 07:22.849
2,

07:23.680 --> 07:25.419
and SPIRIT.

07:25.622 --> 07:27.279
All right, keep moving, guys.

07:27.350 --> 07:31.627
We are going to add the jumping
jack to our punches, so we're

07:31.638 --> 07:34.639
going to do two jumping jacks,
two uppercuts.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.549
So let's try this.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.389
That's 1,

07:39.520 --> 07:40.249
2,

07:40.520 --> 07:41.759
uppercut, uppercut.

07:41.910 --> 07:42.749
1,

07:43.940 --> 07:44.679
2,

07:45.720 --> 07:47.269
uppercut, uppercut.

07:50.280 --> 07:51.349
There you go.

07:55.720 --> 07:56.869
Uppercut,

07:57.110 --> 07:58.179
jumping jacks.

08:02.430 --> 08:03.299
Nice.

08:06.770 --> 08:08.069
Good job, Kristian.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.739
Awesome, Avery.

08:25.830 --> 08:26.799
Nice work.

08:36.780 --> 08:37.489
10,

08:38.100 --> 08:38.939
9,

08:39.640 --> 08:40.429
GREAT!

08:41.280 --> 08:42.029
7,

08:42.430 --> 08:43.269
6,

08:44.350 --> 08:45.139
5----------

08:46.360 --> 08:47.069
4,

08:48.200 --> 08:48.989
3,

08:50.160 --> 08:50.839
2,

08:51.660 --> 08:54.239
and SPIRIT.

08:55.570 --> 08:56.719
Great job.

08:59.700 --> 09:00.543
All right.

09:00.662 --> 09:02.491
Amazing stuff, Marcela.

09:02.556 --> 09:03.403
Good job, Avery.

09:03.452 --> 09:04.529
Good job, everybody.

09:05.220 --> 09:06.319
Awesome work.

09:06.390 --> 09:10.459
That was not easy combining
those exercises with the punches.

09:10.620 --> 09:12.129
Let's go get some water.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.389
Good job, everyone.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.739
Oh, man, that was tough.

09:23.240 --> 09:24.339
Coordination.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.769
Was it easy?

09:28.300 --> 09:29.529
Not at all.

09:30.140 --> 09:32.243
But we did it, Marcela and
Avery, we made it through

09:32.254 --> 09:33.609
everybody, so

09:35.020 --> 09:35.863
we win.

09:35.982 --> 09:38.839
But there's more to come,
everybody, so good job.

09:38.990 --> 09:40.563
That was our first round.

09:40.612 --> 09:43.127
Before we officially take a
break, we're going to pick

09:43.138 --> 09:46.871
ourselves back up and get ready
for our challenge, where we're

09:46.882 --> 09:49.927
going to do 1 minute of an
exercise, and our goal is to

09:49.938 --> 09:53.163
get as many reps of that
exercise as we can.

09:53.202 --> 09:56.969
So what we're going to do is
we're going to do a little side

09:56.980 --> 10:00.111
punching, so you can do this
three different ways.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.959
We got the seated version, we
got Marcela

10:03.720 --> 10:04.899
with the baseline,

10:05.640 --> 10:07.763
and you can do it with me.

10:07.802 --> 10:10.629
So what I'll be doing is a side
step

10:11.240 --> 10:12.419
with a punch.

10:12.760 --> 10:15.855
Side step, punch, punch.

10:16.048 --> 10:18.903
So you're punching to the left
and the right.

10:19.022 --> 10:20.967
You can pick which punch you
want to do.

10:21.054 --> 10:24.889
You can do the jab, you can do
the hook, or the upper cut.

10:25.580 --> 10:29.097
So you're just turning your
body to the side, throwing two

10:29.108 --> 10:31.963
punches, same thing on the
other side.

10:32.162 --> 10:35.176
All right, so each side that
you do, that's going to count

10:35.176 --> 10:36.270
as one.

10:37.520 --> 10:40.603
So in 10 seconds, we're going
to get started and try to get

10:40.614 --> 10:42.479
in as many as we can.

10:42.550 --> 10:45.583
So everybody get into your
stance, get that bounce going.

10:45.702 --> 10:46.769
Let's get ready.

10:51.620 --> 10:52.739
And here we go.

10:52.810 --> 10:53.663
Side punches

10:53.712 --> 10:54.275
in 3,

10:54.378 --> 10:54.883
2,

10:55.002 --> 10:55.427
1,

10:55.514 --> 10:56.549
let's do it.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.869
Nice shot, Marcela.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.099
Good work, Avery.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.629
Awesome job, everybody, keep it
going.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.019
30 seconds, almost there.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.029
20, keep it going, everybody.

11:50.760 --> 11:53.299
Let's try to push a little bit
harder.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.049
10,

11:59.420 --> 12:00.169
9,

12:00.540 --> 12:01.289
GREAT!

12:01.740 --> 12:02.409
7,

12:02.710 --> 12:03.619
6,

12:04.070 --> 12:04.899
5----------

12:05.260 --> 12:06.149
4,

12:06.340 --> 12:07.139
3,

12:07.520 --> 12:08.429
2,

12:08.700 --> 12:10.299
and SPIRIT.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.943
Awesome job, everybody.

12:12.142 --> 12:14.199
Good work, Marcela and Avery.

12:15.440 --> 12:18.631
All right, on that note, let's
go take a break, so pull up

12:18.642 --> 12:19.747
those chairs.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.251
We're going to get about a
minute of resting before we

12:22.262 --> 12:25.809
pick it back up for round
number two.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.311
Way to go, everybody.

12:27.446 --> 12:28.529
Awesome job.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.249
All right, that was fun.

12:37.620 --> 12:40.751
Worked our way through all
three of our punches.

12:40.816 --> 12:44.149
Got a little cardio exercise in
there.

12:45.960 --> 12:49.553
So next step, we're going to
work on some defensive moves

12:49.553 --> 12:53.400
and bring those together to go
along with the punches.

13:00.240 --> 13:03.687
Avery and Marcela, do you two
have a favorite punch of the

13:03.698 --> 13:04.429
three?

13:06.480 --> 13:08.299
I like the jab punch.

13:08.670 --> 13:10.449
Jab punch, okay.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.329
Marcela, which one do you like?

13:13.780 --> 13:15.215
I like it all.

13:15.398 --> 13:16.063
All of them?

13:16.102 --> 13:18.719
Okay, you just like to throw
punches?

13:19.140 --> 13:19.889
Yes.

13:21.540 --> 13:22.629
How about you?

13:24.600 --> 13:27.299
I like the upper cut, I like
the power punch.

13:30.200 --> 13:36.575
Jab is fun, hook is good, but
the upper cut, just bring all

13:36.586 --> 13:39.849
your energy together, and one
boom, that's it, done.

13:40.300 --> 13:43.175
The jab punch is kind of like a
surprising punch, though, right?

13:43.198 --> 13:45.449
So you can snap it real quick,

13:47.920 --> 13:48.909
catch them.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.803
And you don't have to use too
much energy either.

13:51.922 --> 13:52.589
Yeah.

13:56.960 --> 13:59.869
All right, everybody, if you've
got a favorite punch out there,

14:00.720 --> 14:02.619
let us know in the chat.

14:04.640 --> 14:05.775
All right, here we go.

14:05.798 --> 14:07.215
So let's get back into it.

14:07.238 --> 14:10.171
We're going to do round number
two now, and as I said, we're

14:10.182 --> 14:13.247
going to add in some defense to
go along with the moves that we

14:13.258 --> 14:14.275
already worked on.

14:14.378 --> 14:15.411
So let's get to it.

14:15.466 --> 14:17.829
First things first, we're going
to get into our boxing stance,

14:17.829 --> 14:20.470
get those hands up, get that
bounce going.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.591
All right, our first defensive
move, we're going to start off

14:26.602 --> 14:27.843
with the shoulder roll.

14:27.892 --> 14:32.033
So for the shoulder roll, we're
just leaning side to side,

14:32.033 --> 14:34.184
rolling those shoulders left to
right.

14:34.300 --> 14:37.075
Just imagine there's a punch
coming towards your face and

14:37.086 --> 14:40.471
you've got to avoid that punch,
so roll your shoulders as quick

14:40.482 --> 14:43.199
as you can so you don't get hit.

14:43.760 --> 14:44.909
Let's go.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.429
There's Avery doing a great job

14:49.040 --> 14:52.799
with the quick side to side
movement, avoiding those punches.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.155
Good work, everybody.

15:02.278 --> 15:03.987
So we practiced left to right.

15:04.074 --> 15:06.389
Let's do the same thing right
to left.

15:06.920 --> 15:08.447
Awesome, Marcela.

15:08.544 --> 15:10.339
Way to add in the footwork.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.810
All right, everybody, we're
going to keep those shoulder

15:17.810 --> 15:22.227
rolls going, but we're going to
add two jabs and then shoulder

15:22.228 --> 15:22.656
rolls.

15:22.688 --> 15:25.727
So we're going left, right jab,
following it up with the

15:25.738 --> 15:27.139
shoulder rolls.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.149
Good work, everybody.

15:35.240 --> 15:37.889
Jab, jab, shoulder roll.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.675
As Avery mentioned earlier,
after you finish your

15:41.686 --> 15:43.729
combination, make sure you reset.

15:43.814 --> 15:45.327
Get those hands back up.

15:45.414 --> 15:47.567
Cover your face and your body.

15:47.654 --> 15:48.959
Stay protected.

15:50.660 --> 15:51.711
Awesome work, Avery.

15:51.766 --> 15:53.279
Good job, Marcela.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.559
All right, we're going to take
it a step further, everybody.

15:56.630 --> 15:58.015
We're going to add in another
punch.

15:58.048 --> 16:00.927
So we're still keeping our jab,
jab, shoulder roll, but we're

16:00.938 --> 16:03.171
going to add in two hooks at
the end.

16:03.226 --> 16:06.819
So jab, jab, shoulder roll,
shoulder roll, hook, hook.

16:07.980 --> 16:08.969
Let's go.

16:11.420 --> 16:13.559
Awesome work, Marcela.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.223
Nice job with those.

16:15.262 --> 16:16.359
Quick punches.

16:16.860 --> 16:18.619
Quick shoulder rolls.

16:22.560 --> 16:23.675
Awesome, everybody.

16:23.778 --> 16:24.909
We got 10,

16:25.280 --> 16:26.029
9,

16:26.400 --> 16:27.149
GREAT!

16:27.600 --> 16:28.229
7,

16:28.530 --> 16:29.459
6,

16:29.690 --> 16:30.499
5----------

16:30.890 --> 16:31.729
4,

16:31.950 --> 16:32.749
3,

16:33.090 --> 16:33.979
2,

16:34.340 --> 16:36.079
and SPIRIT.

16:36.660 --> 16:37.855
Way to go, everybody.

16:37.958 --> 16:38.849
Good job.

16:39.540 --> 16:40.507
All right, Avery's

16:40.524 --> 16:42.849
going to show us our next move.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.563
All right, Kristian, our next
defensive move that we're going

16:45.574 --> 16:47.663
to practice here today is going
to be the duck.

16:47.792 --> 16:48.115
All right?

16:48.138 --> 16:51.989
So if you're doing it seated
like myself, it's sort of like a

16:52.600 --> 16:53.631
seated crunch.

16:53.696 --> 16:55.283
So I'm just going to duck like
this.

16:55.322 --> 16:56.655
My hands are still going to be
up.

16:56.700 --> 16:59.269
My head is going to be up so I
can see.

16:59.420 --> 17:00.871
I'm going to duck like this.

17:00.926 --> 17:03.091
Okay, let's just practice.

17:03.236 --> 17:06.569
You can check out Marcela and
Kristian if you're standing to

17:06.580 --> 17:07.755
follow along with them.

17:07.778 --> 17:08.349
Okay?

17:12.640 --> 17:14.299
Great job, Marcela.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.191
Remember, when you're ducking,
you still want to keep your

17:19.202 --> 17:20.369
guard up.

17:22.820 --> 17:25.707
Sometimes when you duck, that's
when you get caught with that

17:25.718 --> 17:27.211
uppercut, Kristian.

17:27.356 --> 17:28.289
Oh, yeah.

17:29.780 --> 17:31.009
Hands up, everybody.

17:33.719 --> 17:34.709
Great job.

17:38.360 --> 17:41.036
All right, let's rock this out
for about another 20 seconds,

17:41.036 --> 17:43.219
and then we're going to add
some punches.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.319
Great work, everyone.

17:51.389 --> 17:52.329
Keep it up.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.171
All right.

17:58.226 --> 17:58.923
10,

17:59.121 --> 17:59.869
9,

18:00.320 --> 18:01.069
GREAT!

18:01.440 --> 18:02.169
7,

18:02.489 --> 18:03.218
6,

18:03.830 --> 18:04.549
5----------

18:04.989 --> 18:05.849
4,

18:06.210 --> 18:06.999
3,

18:07.550 --> 18:08.249
2,

18:08.639 --> 18:09.959
and SPIRIT.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.138
All right, we're still going to
keep our guards up.

18:12.210 --> 18:13.959
We're still practicing our duck.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.246
Now, this time around, we're
going to duck, and then we're

18:16.257 --> 18:19.143
going to throw a right hook and
a left hook.

18:19.190 --> 18:22.999
Okay, so we're going to duck,
right, left.

18:23.080 --> 18:26.649
Guard's up, duck, right, left.

18:26.710 --> 18:29.759
Guard's up, duck, right, left.

18:33.390 --> 18:35.429
Great job transitioning,
everyone.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.179
Good work, Kristian.

18:50.470 --> 18:51.369
Excellent.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.139
Great job, Marcela.

19:00.660 --> 19:02.399
All right, 20 seconds.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.947
All right, let's finish it out
strong, everyone.

19:17.034 --> 19:17.669
10,

19:18.200 --> 19:18.949
9,

19:19.400 --> 19:20.149
GREAT!

19:20.760 --> 19:21.489
7,

19:21.920 --> 19:22.649
6,

19:23.470 --> 19:24.269
5----------

19:24.980 --> 19:25.829
4,

19:26.460 --> 19:27.359
3,

19:28.040 --> 19:28.889
2,

19:29.180 --> 19:30.595
and SPIRIT.

19:30.708 --> 19:34.115
All right, we're going to keep
that same process going, but

19:34.126 --> 19:35.575
this time we're going to

19:35.660 --> 19:40.649
duck, hook, hook, duck again,
right uppercut, left uppercut.

19:40.706 --> 19:42.859
Okay, so that's going to be a
duck,

19:43.360 --> 19:45.879
hook, hook, another duck,

19:46.040 --> 19:47.387
uppercut, upper cut.

19:47.474 --> 19:48.109
Okay?

19:48.800 --> 19:53.799
Duck, hook, hook, duck again,
uppercut, uppercut.

19:53.890 --> 19:54.239
Great.

19:54.310 --> 19:55.329
Just like that.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.399
30 seconds.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.589
Let's knock it out.

20:08.520 --> 20:09.299
Literally.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.219
Great work, Kristian.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.119
Great job, Marcela.

20:25.420 --> 20:27.319
All right, 15 seconds.

20:35.520 --> 20:36.091
All right.

20:36.146 --> 20:36.843
10,

20:37.042 --> 20:37.789
9,

20:38.240 --> 20:38.989
GREAT!

20:39.540 --> 20:40.379
7,

20:40.610 --> 20:41.319
6,

20:41.920 --> 20:42.629
5----------

20:43.240 --> 20:43.999
4,

20:44.540 --> 20:45.309
3,

20:46.140 --> 20:46.969
2,

20:47.380 --> 20:48.959
and SPIRIT.

20:50.020 --> 20:51.087
Great work, everyone.

20:51.174 --> 20:52.143
Great work.

20:52.342 --> 20:54.849
All right, Marcela, what do you
have for us next?

20:55.220 --> 20:58.419
All right, our next defense
move is going to be the block.

20:58.540 --> 21:02.590
So for this one, try to bring
those elbows together right in

21:02.602 --> 21:04.629
front of our face to protect.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.383
So we're going to start first
with our blocks.

21:08.512 --> 21:10.099
Side to side blocks.

21:13.160 --> 21:13.619
Again.

21:13.690 --> 21:14.869
Just like that.

21:22.640 --> 21:23.709
Very good.

21:28.710 --> 21:29.799
Good job, Kristian.

21:42.280 --> 21:43.619
Nice, Avery.

21:46.520 --> 21:49.903
We're going to keep going with
this block, and we're going to

21:49.914 --> 21:52.419
add some punches to the block.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.939
Let's do that for another 10
seconds,

21:56.600 --> 21:57.339
9,

21:57.900 --> 21:58.709
GREAT!

21:59.150 --> 21:59.919
7,

22:00.430 --> 22:01.259
6,

22:01.660 --> 22:02.429
5----------

22:02.890 --> 22:03.689
4,

22:04.150 --> 22:04.909
3,

22:05.500 --> 22:06.259
2,

22:06.540 --> 22:08.359
and SPIRIT.

22:08.540 --> 22:10.507
Good job, everyone, keep moving.

22:10.674 --> 22:12.555
Time for our uppercuts.

22:12.660 --> 22:16.239
So we're going to do a block,
uppercut, uppercut.

22:17.060 --> 22:19.549
Block, uppercut, uppercut.

22:22.260 --> 22:23.239
Nice.

22:23.380 --> 22:25.709
Block, uppercut, uppercut.

22:30.110 --> 22:31.079
Excellent.

22:39.080 --> 22:39.839
Block,

22:40.840 --> 22:41.919
and uppercuts.

22:42.410 --> 22:43.719
Looking good, Avery.

22:43.720 --> 22:44.629
Good job.

22:51.410 --> 22:52.879
Nice, Kristian.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.009
Good job, Marcela.

22:56.300 --> 22:58.309
Get ready to add another punch.

23:00.800 --> 23:01.759
So we're going to do

23:01.760 --> 23:05.819
block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

23:06.260 --> 23:11.469
Block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

23:12.260 --> 23:15.739
Block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

23:15.800 --> 23:16.899
There we go.

23:24.230 --> 23:25.899
A lot to think in here.

23:27.980 --> 23:29.049
Nice work.

23:33.700 --> 23:35.209
Good job, Kristian.

23:39.240 --> 23:41.829
Nice, keep it up, keep it up,
almost there.

23:44.500 --> 23:45.179
10,

23:46.020 --> 23:46.789
9,

23:47.510 --> 23:48.299
GREAT!

23:48.800 --> 23:49.589
7,

23:49.940 --> 23:50.789
6,

23:51.370 --> 23:52.099
5----------

23:53.000 --> 23:53.819
4,

23:54.330 --> 23:55.099
3,

23:57.780 --> 23:59.379
SPIRIT.

24:00.990 --> 24:02.199
Awesome.

24:03.060 --> 24:03.919
All right.

24:04.070 --> 24:06.011
Way to go, Marcela.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.689
Way to go, Avery.

24:08.908 --> 24:11.151
That was a real workout,
everybody.

24:11.286 --> 24:12.483
Good job.

24:12.522 --> 24:14.869
Let's go get another quick sip
of water.

24:20.680 --> 24:23.587
All right, congratulations,
everybody.

24:23.674 --> 24:27.375
We made it to the finish line,
and we did it with style.

24:27.488 --> 24:29.735
You all did an amazing job
today.

24:29.918 --> 24:32.146
So what we're going to do next,
we're going to finish it off

24:32.158 --> 24:35.186
with some cool down stretches
so we can relax all those

24:35.198 --> 24:37.879
muscles that we fired up today.

24:38.030 --> 24:40.983
Our first stretch, we're going
to start off with the side bend.

24:41.032 --> 24:42.103
We're going to get our core.

24:42.152 --> 24:44.279
We did a lot of twisting and
turning.

24:44.440 --> 24:45.469
We're going to

24:46.080 --> 24:51.125
help those muscles relax by
bringing one arm up and over

24:51.125 --> 24:53.250
and leaning to the opposite side.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.399
We'll hold it for 10 seconds

24:57.140 --> 24:58.619
and then switch.

25:03.720 --> 25:04.467
3,

25:04.634 --> 25:05.395
2,

25:05.578 --> 25:07.443
and switch it up.

25:07.562 --> 25:09.509
Same thing on the other side.

25:20.680 --> 25:21.409
5----------

25:21.610 --> 25:22.409
4,

25:22.510 --> 25:23.249
3,

25:23.270 --> 25:24.079
2,

25:24.170 --> 25:25.003
and SPIRIT.

25:25.072 --> 25:25.543
Good job.

25:25.582 --> 25:27.282
Now we're going to take both
hands and we're going to reach

25:27.294 --> 25:30.551
them down towards the floor,
and we're going to hold it.

25:30.606 --> 25:33.670
If you're standing up, try to
keep those legs nice and

25:33.682 --> 25:34.619
straight.

25:37.760 --> 25:40.139
Reach down towards the floor.

25:48.020 --> 25:48.829
5----------

25:49.010 --> 25:49.739
4,

25:49.940 --> 25:50.659
3,

25:50.830 --> 25:51.599
2,

25:51.670 --> 25:52.523
and SPIRIT.

25:52.572 --> 25:53.119
Good job.

25:53.190 --> 25:54.079
Last one, everybody.

25:54.150 --> 25:56.993
We're going to reach in the
opposite direction now, hands

25:56.993 --> 25:58.292
up above our head.

25:58.346 --> 26:01.155
Get those shoulders and arms
stretched out.

26:01.178 --> 26:03.316
