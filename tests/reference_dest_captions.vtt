00:00:52.938 --> 00:00:55.727
Along with me to give you all a

00:00:55.738 --> 00:00:58.197
two amazing trainers who are

00:00:58.208 --> 00:00:59.669
to you all.

8
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.675
Hello, everyone.

9
00:01:01.858 --> 00:01:03.447
My name is Marcella.

10
00:01:03.544 --> 00:01:06.139
Very happy to be here with you.

11
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.109
I hope you guys enjoy the class.

12
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.523
Hello, everyone.

13
00:01:10.642 --> 00:01:12.039
My name is Avery.

14
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.611
Thanks for joining us today.

15
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:16.735
Like Marcela said, I hope you
guys are ready for a great class.

16
00:01:16.918 --> 00:01:18.959
Let's jump right into it,
Kristian.

17
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.795
All right, let's do it, Avery.

18
00:01:20.828 --> 00:01:22.043
Let's do it, Marcela.

19
00:01:22.092 --> 00:01:22.991
Let's go, everybody.

20
00:01:23.126 --> 00:01:25.776
So we're going to kick our
class off with some warm up

21
00:01:25.788 --> 00:01:29.509
exercises so we can get the
blood flowing, get our

22
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.339
body parts

23
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.703
ready for some action.

24
00:01:34.752 --> 00:01:37.007
All right, so first thing we're
going to start with everybody,

25
00:01:37.018 --> 00:01:38.735
we're just going to do some
side bends.

26
00:01:38.768 --> 00:01:41.603
So let's spread those arms out
to the side, and then we're

27
00:01:41.614 --> 00:01:44.050
going to lean left to right,
trying to reach those

28
00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:47.529
fingertips as close to the
floor as we can.

29
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.769
Here we go.

30
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.698
Good job, everybody.

31
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.859
Looking good, Avery and Marcela.

32
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.091
Make sure you all are reaching
those fingertips a little bit

33
00:02:04.102 --> 00:02:05.649
lower each time.

34
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.871
Good work, Avery.

35
00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:17.279
Good job, Marcela.

36
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.515
10 seconds, everybody.

37
00:02:18.618 --> 00:02:19.589
Keep it going.

38
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.239
5----------

39
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.409
4,

40
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.379
3,

41
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.569
2,

42
00:02:28.698 --> 00:02:29.759
and SPIRIT.

43
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.419
Good job.

44
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.683
Next up, we're going to bring
our elbows up to our sides and

45
00:02:33.694 --> 00:02:35.719
we're going to twist left to
right.

46
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.763
This is our torso twist.

47
00:02:37.892 --> 00:02:41.421
We're going to open up our hips
and our midsections by twisting

48
00:02:41.432 --> 00:02:42.509
side to side.

49
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.629
Here we go.

50
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.649
Good job, everybody.

51
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.299
Nice work, Avery.

52
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.231
Excellent, Marcela.

53
00:03:06.296 --> 00:03:07.629
Keep it going, everybody.

54
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.331
All right, we're going to add
on to our twist with some

55
00:03:12.342 --> 00:03:15.779
punches so twist and punch.

56
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.649
Twist and punch.

57
00:03:18.716 --> 00:03:20.209
Everybody, let's go.

58
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.819
Good job.

59
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.651
We got 15 seconds.

60
00:03:32.736 --> 00:03:33.939
Let's go faster.

61
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.969
Pick it up.

62
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.099
5----------

63
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.269
4,

64
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.469
3,

65
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.559
2,

66
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.135
and SPIRIT.

67
00:03:50.248 --> 00:03:51.339
Awesome, everybody.

68
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.451
All right, we're going to move
on to our arms next.

69
00:03:55.506 --> 00:03:58.846
So we're going to wrap our arms
up around our upper bodies,

70
00:03:58.846 --> 00:04:01.552
give ourselves a nice big
squeeze, and then we're going

71
00:04:01.552 --> 00:04:04.204
to pull them apart, big and wide.

72
00:04:04.332 --> 00:04:06.319
This is our SPIRIT fly.

73
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.149
Get our chest and shoulders
nice and ready.

74
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.515
All right.

75
00:04:20.618 --> 00:04:23.689
Nice stretch, Avery, way to
open those arms up.

76
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.559
Awesome work, Marcela.

77
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.583
All right, everybody, 10
seconds.

78
00:04:36.632 --> 00:04:39.819
Let's try to pull those arms
back further.

79
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.749
5----------

80
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.989
4,

81
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.199
3,

82
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.309
2,

83
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.011
and SPIRIT.

84
00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:51.103
Nice, everybody.

85
00:04:51.222 --> 00:04:53.131
Up next, we're going to do some
swings.

86
00:04:53.196 --> 00:04:56.667
We're going to do some leg
swings and some arm swings.

87
00:04:56.764 --> 00:04:59.279
So here's the leg swings.

88
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.575
If you want to do the arm
swings, you can follow along

89
00:05:02.586 --> 00:05:03.939
with Avery.

90
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.869
There it is right there.

91
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.029
Getting those legs and arms up.

92
00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.849
Getting a nice reach, everybody,
so let's get to it.

93
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.989
Good work, Marcela.

94
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.139
Good job, everyone.

95
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.389
Keep it going.

96
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.449
5----------

97
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.819
4,

98
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.119
3,

99
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.299
2,

100
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.971
and SPIRIT.

101
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.229
Awesome.

102
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.769
All right, we're going to get
into a little bit of cardio so

103
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.447
we can get our heart rates up.

104
00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:54.059
So what we're going to do next,
everybody, is some jump rope.

105
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.729
Let's get those invisible jump
ropes out.

106
00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.649
Get a bounce going.

107
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.089
Let's move it.

108
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.709
Good job, everybody.

109
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.635
All right.

110
00:06:18.738 --> 00:06:20.139
Nice, Avery.

111
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.179
Good job, Marcela.

112
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.791
All right, you all, we're
almost there.

113
00:06:35.846 --> 00:06:37.371
We got 15 seconds.

114
00:06:37.436 --> 00:06:39.839
Let's see if we can move it a
little faster.

115
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.135
Awesome.

116
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.789
We got 5,

117
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.899
4,

118
00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.069
3,

119
00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.239
2,

120
00:06:59.442 --> 00:07:00.695
and SPIRIT.

121
00:07:00.808 --> 00:07:03.069
All right, keep that bounce
going, everybody.

122
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.779
Up next we're going to run in
place.

123
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.827
So we're keeping our bounce
going, but we're going to pump

124
00:07:10.838 --> 00:07:13.855
our arms to go along with it.

125
00:07:13.878 --> 00:07:15.649
So we're just running in place.

126
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.809
If you have some space, you can
go side to side,

127
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.669
forward and back.

128
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.547
All right.

129
00:07:32.634 --> 00:07:37.879
Nice arm swing, Avery, keep
those arms pumping.

130
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:45.719
All right.

131
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:46.803
Nice, Marcela.

132
00:07:46.852 --> 00:07:48.155
Let's double time, everybody.

133
00:07:48.258 --> 00:07:50.059
Faster, faster, faster.

134
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.167
All right, so up next, we're
going to do a little bit of

135
00:07:56.178 --> 00:07:57.191
speedbag.

136
00:07:57.256 --> 00:07:59.869
So we're going to keep the
bounce going, but we're going

137
00:07:59.869 --> 00:08:04.260
to roll one hand over the other
as fast as we can, just like we

138
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.080
would if we're hitting the
speedbag.

139
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:08.649
Let's do it.

140
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.269
You can go up, down, side to
side,

141
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.929
just keep those hands rolling.

142
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.274
Good job, everybody.

143
00:08:26.457 --> 00:08:27.779
10 seconds.

144
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.038
Look at those quick hands from
Avery.

145
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:33.928
Good job.

146
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:37.689
5----------

147
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.139
4,

148
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.349
3,

149
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.609
2,

150
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.919
and SPIRIT.

151
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.275
Excellent, everybody.

152
00:08:45.378 --> 00:08:46.427
Good job, Marcela.

153
00:08:46.514 --> 00:08:47.831
Good job, Avery.

154
00:08:47.976 --> 00:08:50.849
All right, you all, we're going
to take ourselves a quick break.

155
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:56.169
While we're taking our break,
you all can get yourself set up

156
00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:00.319
by having water, of course, so
you can stay hydrated.

157
00:09:00.508 --> 00:09:03.899
Keep a chair nearby just so you
can rest up in between our

158
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:04.495
breaks.

159
00:09:04.528 --> 00:09:07.845
And if you do have boxing
gloves, you can get those laced

160
00:09:07.856 --> 00:09:08.629
up now.

161
00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.475
And we're going to start in
about 30 seconds, everybody.

162
00:09:13.578 --> 00:09:15.449
Good job with the warm up.

163
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.063
Hope you all are feeling fired
up and ready to go.

164
00:09:19.182 --> 00:09:20.889
We're going to have some fun
today.

165
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.769
That was a great warm up.

166
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:25.607
Nice.

167
00:09:25.694 --> 00:09:26.823
Yes, it was.

168
00:09:27.022 --> 00:09:28.519
The music helped.

169
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.909
Yeah, definitely.

170
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.989
All right, Marcela, Avery, are
we ready to go?

171
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.299
Ready to go.

172
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:38.939
Ready.

173
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:40.363
Let's do it.

174
00:09:40.562 --> 00:09:44.209
All right, you all, so here we
go.

175
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.411
First thing we're going to do,
everybody, we're going to start

176
00:09:48.422 --> 00:09:51.851
it off with a little general
exercise so we can get a little

177
00:09:51.862 --> 00:09:56.335
bit more warmed up, get our
body nice and fluid.

178
00:09:56.368 --> 00:09:58.607
So we're going to start off
with some floor touches.

179
00:09:58.624 --> 00:10:01.007
So we're going to reach those
hands up high, and then we're

180
00:10:01.018 --> 00:10:03.699
reaching them down towards the
floor.

181
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.071
And even if you can't touch the
floor, just reach those

182
00:10:07.082 --> 00:10:10.559
fingertips as close as you can
and try to get a little closer

183
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:11.491
each time.

184
00:10:11.546 --> 00:10:13.459
So we're going up and down.

185
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.469
Let's do it.

186
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.109
Good work, Marcela.

187
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.529
Good job, Avery.

188
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.939
Awesome, everybody out there,
keep it going.

189
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.339
We've got 10 seconds.

190
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.109
5----------

191
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:50.379
4,

192
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:51.549
3,

193
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:52.729
2,

194
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.223
and SPIRIT.

195
00:10:54.352 --> 00:10:55.459
Awesome, everybody.

196
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.283
All right, we're going to
change gears now.

197
00:10:57.322 --> 00:10:59.067
We're going into boxing mode.

198
00:10:59.184 --> 00:11:01.143
So let's get those hands up.

199
00:11:01.182 --> 00:11:03.527
The back hand is going to be
covering the face.

200
00:11:03.694 --> 00:11:05.671
The front is going to cover the
body.

201
00:11:05.806 --> 00:11:07.603
If you're doing this one
standing, you're going to have

202
00:11:07.614 --> 00:11:08.895
a staggered stance.

203
00:11:08.948 --> 00:11:10.491
One foot in front of the other.

204
00:11:10.626 --> 00:11:13.735
And we're just going to get a
nice bounce going while we're

205
00:11:13.746 --> 00:11:16.059
in our boxing stance.

206
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.589
All right, so let's do it.

207
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.009
Move around a little bit,

208
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.479
find your rhythm.

209
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.879
All right, there's Avery.

210
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.335
He's feeling it.

211
00:11:30.358 --> 00:11:31.583
He's got those hands up.

212
00:11:31.622 --> 00:11:32.869
He's ready for anything.

213
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.589
Marcela, same thing.

214
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.483
She's ready to go.

215
00:11:40.522 --> 00:11:42.303
So let's do it, everybody,
first punch.

216
00:11:42.352 --> 00:11:45.311
We're going to start off with
our right jab.

217
00:11:45.376 --> 00:11:48.611
So we're just throwing a
straightforward punch and then

218
00:11:48.622 --> 00:11:52.649
back into our stance with the
hands up.

219
00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.399
So quick right jab.

220
00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:06.009
And as you're throwing those
punches, make sure you lean

221
00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:09.500
into them to get more power,
get better balance.

222
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.399
Let's see it, Marcela.

223
00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:13.775
Nice.

224
00:12:13.878 --> 00:12:14.769
Good job.

225
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.559
Way to step into those punches.

226
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.069
All right, let's switch it up
to the left jab, everybody.

227
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.887
Left jab.

228
00:12:25.984 --> 00:12:26.869
Let's go.

229
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.375
All right, there's Avery with
those blazing flash jabs.

230
00:12:33.568 --> 00:12:34.469
Good job.

231
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.107
Good work, everybody.

232
00:12:41.194 --> 00:12:42.339
Let's bring the two together.

233
00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:46.709
Now we're going right and left
jab back to back.

234
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.189
Good job, everybody.

235
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.799
Right and left.

236
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:06.659
All right.

237
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.475
We change it up in the other
direction.

238
00:13:08.508 --> 00:13:10.495
We'll go left and right.

239
00:13:10.598 --> 00:13:12.819
We'll go back and forth between
the two.

240
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.069
Leading with the left, leading
with the right.

241
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.219
Awesome, Marcela.

242
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.729
All right, everybody, we got 5,

243
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.089
4,

244
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:31.379
3,

245
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:32.859
2,

246
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.859
and SPIRIT.

247
00:13:34.868 --> 00:13:36.089
Nice work.

248
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.523
All right, we've got one more
thing before we move along.

249
00:13:39.662 --> 00:13:43.303
We're going to take the floor
touch and the jabs and we're

250
00:13:43.303 --> 00:13:46.676
going to put the two together
just so we can work on some

251
00:13:46.676 --> 00:13:50.604
coordination, being able to
switch gears in an instant.

252
00:13:50.652 --> 00:13:55.195
So we're going to touch our
toes, pop up, one, two jab.

253
00:13:55.388 --> 00:13:58.879
Floor touch, quick, jab, jab.

254
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.389
Awesome, everybody.

255
00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.299
Floor touch, pop up, jab, jab.

256
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.391
There you go, Avery.

257
00:14:17.466 --> 00:14:18.329
Nice work.

258
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.855
All right, let's take it a step
further, everybody.

259
00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:26.359
Floor touch, pop up, four jabs,

260
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.469
1, 2, 3, 4.

261
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.079
And a little bit more quickness
with those punches.

262
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.029
Let's go.

263
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.203
Good job, Marcela.

264
00:14:41.272 --> 00:14:41.889
10,

265
00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.103
9,

266
00:14:43.302 --> 00:14:44.049
GREAT!

267
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.149
7,

268
00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.199
6,

269
00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.389
5----------

270
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.479
4,

271
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.599
3,

272
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.799
2,

273
00:14:51.062 --> 00:14:52.539
and SPIRIT.

274
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.969
Way to go, everybody.

275
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.535
Great job.

276
00:14:55.638 --> 00:14:57.659
Alright, we're gonna pass it
along to Avery.

277
00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.839
He's going to lead us with the
next segment.

278
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.191
All right, Kristian, what we're
going to start off doing this

279
00:15:02.191 --> 00:15:04.119
time around, we're going to
start off doing some shoulder

280
00:15:04.119 --> 00:15:04.784
presses.

281
00:15:04.832 --> 00:15:08.629
We're going to get about a good
30 seconds in of just pressing

282
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:09.430
up,

283
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.589
like raising the roof.

284
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.569
Let's get about 30 seconds in
of this, okay?

285
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.363
Just like that.

286
00:15:20.402 --> 00:15:21.229
Great job.

287
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.269
There's Marcela.

288
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.539
Great job, Marcela.

289
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.049
Kristian raising the roof.

290
00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.799
Already feeling the burn.

291
00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.967
All right, we're about 15
seconds in.

292
00:15:38.134 --> 00:15:39.439
Let's finish it out strong.

293
00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.009
Let's pick it up a little bit.

294
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.739
All right, 5,

295
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:54.909
4,

296
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:55.859
3,

297
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:57.159
2,

298
00:15:57.306 --> 00:15:58.679
and SPIRIT.

299
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.631
All right, great job.

300
00:16:00.686 --> 00:16:02.843
With that, we're going to jump
right back into our boxing

301
00:16:02.843 --> 00:16:03.572
stance.

302
00:16:03.716 --> 00:16:07.027
This time around, we're going
to start off just throwing some

303
00:16:07.038 --> 00:16:08.429
right hook punches, okay?

304
00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.789
And remember, when you're
throwing this hook punch, you

305
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.803
want to follow through all the
way across the front of your

306
00:16:23.814 --> 00:16:24.719
chest.

307
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.759
Great job, Kristian.

308
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.509
All right, we're going to
switch to our left,

309
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.049
just left hook punches only.

310
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.719
Great job, Marcela.

311
00:16:59.599 --> 00:17:01.943
All right, let's get a few more
in and then we're going to put

312
00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:03.068
them both together.

313
00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:11.019
All right, let's put them both
together.

314
00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:12.749
That's going to be a right and
a left.

315
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.749
Great job transitioning, guys.

316
00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.509
Keep it up.

317
00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.119
Great job, everyone.

318
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.049
Keep going.

319
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.051
Don't stop.

320
00:17:51.106 --> 00:17:51.947
Don't think about it.

321
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:53.559
Just keep throwing those
punches.

322
00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.317
All right, let's get ready to
put four of them together,

323
00:18:03.317 --> 00:18:04.110
everyone.

324
00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:05.899
So it's going to be

325
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:06.269
1,

326
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.759
2,

327
00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.209
3,

328
00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:07.779
4.

329
00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.339
Four quick hook punches.

330
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.339
Great job, Marcela.

331
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.289
All right, let's go for 30
seconds, let's finish it out.

332
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.619
And remember, you want to reset
after you throw your punches.

333
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.831
Hands back up, four punches.

334
00:18:47.976 --> 00:18:50.379
Hands up, four punches.

335
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.415
All right, we got 10,

336
00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:01.423
9,

337
00:19:01.622 --> 00:19:02.369
GREAT!

338
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.409
7,

339
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.649
6,

340
00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.699
5----------

341
00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:06.949
4,

342
00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:07.959
3,

343
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.079
2,

344
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.139
and SPIRIT.

345
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.203
All right, great job, everyone.

346
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.163
Before I pass it along to
Marcella, we're going to jump

347
00:19:16.174 --> 00:19:19.043
right back into our shoulder
presses, and we're going to

348
00:19:19.054 --> 00:19:20.759
incorporate hook punches.

349
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.919
Let's say five chest presses,
and then we're going to throw

350
00:19:26.919 --> 00:19:28.616
four hook punches.

351
00:19:28.648 --> 00:19:29.035
Okay?

352
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.079
So 1,

353
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:30.569
2,

354
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:31.139
3,

355
00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:31.709
4,

356
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:32.309
5----------

357
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:33.229
1,

358
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.619
2,

359
00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.069
3,

360
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.599
4.

361
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:35.699
1,

362
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:36.129
2.

363
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:36.639
3,

364
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.139

365
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:37.759
5----------

366
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:38.749
1,

367
00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:39.389
2,

368
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:39.779
3,

369
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:40.209
4.

370
00:19:40.466 --> 00:19:41.329
All right?

371
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:49.791
Great job, everyone.

372
00:19:49.846 --> 00:19:50.769
Keep it up.

373
00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.095
Nice combination, Avery.

374
00:20:00.108 --> 00:20:01.249
Feeling it.

375
00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.169
All right, we got 10,

376
00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:09.289
9,

377
00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:10.855
GREAT!

378
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:11.719
7,

379
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.649
6,

380
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:13.969
5----------

381
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:14.909
4,

382
00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:16.209
3,

383
00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.449
2,

384
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.499
and SPIRIT.

385
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.869
Awesome job, everyone.

386
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.687
Now I'll pass it along to
Marcella and see what she has up

387
00:20:25.698 --> 00:20:26.269
next.

388
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.403
All right.

389
00:20:27.442 --> 00:20:28.423
Thank you, Avery.

390
00:20:28.552 --> 00:20:32.599
Okay, our next target movement
is going to be our jumping jacks.

391
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.607
So I'm going to be doing the
standing version, which is I'm

392
00:20:35.618 --> 00:20:38.619
going to tap to the side, bring
my arms overhead

393
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.829
right in the middle.

394
00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.264
If you're doing the advanced
version, you can follow along

395
00:20:45.264 --> 00:20:46.580
with Kristian.

396
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.209
Nice.

397
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.869
Nice work.

398
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.269
Good job, Avery.

399
00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.459
Keep it going for 20 seconds.

400
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.709
10,

401
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:24.955
9,

402
00:21:25.138 --> 00:21:25.963
GREAT!

403
00:21:26.162 --> 00:21:26.909
7,

404
00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:27.819
6,

405
00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.099
5----------

406
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.089
4,

407
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.019
3,

408
00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:32.269
2,

409
00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:34.809
and SPIRIT.

410
00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:35.889
Awesome.

411
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:36.869
All right,

412
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.231
we're going to do our uppercut,
so we're going to start with

413
00:21:41.242 --> 00:21:42.979
the right uppercut.

414
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.687
You're going to lean on the leg
that is in front of you and

415
00:21:46.698 --> 00:21:50.543
bring that uppercut all the way
through your hips.

416
00:21:50.672 --> 00:21:51.989
All the way through.

417
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.469
So let's do it.

418
00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.349
Right uppercuts.

419
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:04.149
Just like that.

420
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.019
Very good.

421
00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:23.809
Good, Avery.

422
00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.999
Okay, let's do our left
uppercuts.

423
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.399
Left.

424
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.989
Good job, everyone.

425
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:46.789
Keep it going.

426
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.669
All right, let's do them
together.

427
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.409
Right, left, right, left
uppercuts.

428
00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:01.519
All right, let's go.

429
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.169
Right and left, good job.

430
00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:20.179
Good work, Avery.

431
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.259
Excellent.

432
00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.119
Keep it going for 20 more
seconds.

433
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.389
10,

434
00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:44.409
9,

435
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:45.559
GREAT!

436
00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:46.669
7,

437
00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:47.939
6,

438
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:48.959
5----------

439
00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:50.359
4,

440
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.519
3,

441
00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:52.849
2,

442
00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.419
and SPIRIT.

443
00:23:55.622 --> 00:23:57.279
All right, keep moving, guys.

444
00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:01.627
We are going to add the jumping
jack to our punches, so we're

445
00:24:01.638 --> 00:24:04.639
going to do two jumping jacks,
two uppercuts.

446
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.549
So let's try this.

447
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.389
That's 1,

448
00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.249
2,

449
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.759
uppercut, uppercut.

450
00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:12.749
1,

451
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:14.679
2,

452
00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.269
uppercut, uppercut.

453
00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.349
There you go.

454
00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.869
Uppercut,

455
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.179
jumping jacks.

456
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:33.299
Nice.

457
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.069
Good job, Kristian.

458
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.739
Awesome, Avery.

459
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:56.799
Nice work.

460
00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:07.489
10,

461
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:08.939
9,

462
00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.429
GREAT!

463
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.029
7,

464
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:13.269
6,

465
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:15.139
5----------

466
00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.069
4,

467
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:18.989
3,

468
00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:20.839
2,

469
00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:24.239
and SPIRIT.

470
00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:26.719
Great job.

471
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:30.543
All right.

472
00:25:30.662 --> 00:25:32.491
Amazing stuff, Marcela.

473
00:25:32.556 --> 00:25:33.403
Good job, Avery.

474
00:25:33.452 --> 00:25:34.529
Good job, everybody.

475
00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.319
Awesome work.

476
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:40.459
That was not easy combining
those exercises with the punches.

477
00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.129
Let's go get some water.

478
00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.389
Good job, everyone.

479
00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.739
Oh, man, that was tough.

480
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.339
Coordination.

481
00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.769
Was it easy?

482
00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.529
Not at all.

483
00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.243
But we did it, Marcela and
Avery, we made it through

484
00:26:02.254 --> 00:26:03.609
everybody, so

485
00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:05.863
we win.

486
00:26:05.982 --> 00:26:08.839
But there's more to come,
everybody, so good job.

487
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:10.563
That was our first round.

488
00:26:10.612 --> 00:26:13.127
Before we officially take a
break, we're going to pick

489
00:26:13.138 --> 00:26:16.871
ourselves back up and get ready
for our challenge, where we're

490
00:26:16.882 --> 00:26:19.927
going to do 1 minute of an
exercise, and our goal is to

491
00:26:19.938 --> 00:26:23.163
get as many reps of that
exercise as we can.

492
00:26:23.202 --> 00:26:26.969
So what we're going to do is
we're going to do a little side

493
00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.111
punching, so you can do this
three different ways.

494
00:26:30.166 --> 00:26:32.959
We got the seated version, we
got Marcela

495
00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.899
with the baseline,

496
00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.763
and you can do it with me.

497
00:26:37.802 --> 00:26:40.629
So what I'll be doing is a side
step

498
00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.419
with a punch.

499
00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.855
Side step, punch, punch.

500
00:26:46.048 --> 00:26:48.903
So you're punching to the left
and the right.

501
00:26:49.022 --> 00:26:50.967
You can pick which punch you
want to do.

502
00:26:51.054 --> 00:26:54.889
You can do the jab, you can do
the hook, or the upper cut.

503
00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:59.097
So you're just turning your
body to the side, throwing two

504
00:26:59.108 --> 00:27:01.963
punches, same thing on the
other side.

505
00:27:02.162 --> 00:27:05.176
All right, so each side that
you do, that's going to count

506
00:27:05.176 --> 00:27:06.270
as one.

507
00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.603
So in 10 seconds, we're going
to get started and try to get

508
00:27:10.614 --> 00:27:12.479
in as many as we can.

509
00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:15.583
So everybody get into your
stance, get that bounce going.

510
00:27:15.702 --> 00:27:16.769
Let's get ready.

511
00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.739
And here we go.

512
00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:23.663
Side punches

513
00:27:23.712 --> 00:27:24.275
in 3,

514
00:27:24.378 --> 00:27:24.883
2,

515
00:27:25.002 --> 00:27:25.427
1,

516
00:27:25.514 --> 00:27:26.549
let's do it.

517
00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.869
Nice shot, Marcela.

518
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.099
Good work, Avery.

519
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.629
Awesome job, everybody, keep it
going.

520
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.019
30 seconds, almost there.

521
00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.029
20, keep it going, everybody.

522
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.299
Let's try to push a little bit
harder.

523
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.049
10,

524
00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.169
9,

525
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:31.289
GREAT!

526
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.409
7,

527
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:33.619
6,

528
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.899
5----------

529
00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:36.149
4,

530
00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.139
3,

531
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.429
2,

532
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.299
and SPIRIT.

533
00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.943
Awesome job, everybody.

534
00:28:42.142 --> 00:28:44.199
Good work, Marcela and Avery.

535
00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.631
All right, on that note, let's
go take a break, so pull up

536
00:28:48.642 --> 00:28:49.747
those chairs.

537
00:28:49.864 --> 00:28:52.251
We're going to get about a
minute of resting before we

538
00:28:52.262 --> 00:28:55.809
pick it back up for round
number two.

539
00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.311
Way to go, everybody.

540
00:28:57.446 --> 00:28:58.529
Awesome job.

541
00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.249
All right, that was fun.

542
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:10.751
Worked our way through all
three of our punches.

543
00:29:10.816 --> 00:29:14.149
Got a little cardio exercise in
there.

544
00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.553
So next step, we're going to
work on some defensive moves

545
00:29:19.553 --> 00:29:23.400
and bring those together to go
along with the punches.

546
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.687
Avery and Marcela, do you two
have a favorite punch of the

547
00:29:33.698 --> 00:29:34.429
three?

548
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.299
I like the jab punch.

549
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:40.449
Jab punch, okay.

550
00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.329
Marcela, which one do you like?

551
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.215
I like it all.

552
00:29:45.398 --> 00:29:46.063
All of them?

553
00:29:46.102 --> 00:29:48.719
Okay, you just like to throw
punches?

554
00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:49.889
Yes.

555
00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:52.629
How about you?

556
00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.299
I like the upper cut, I like
the power punch.

557
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:06.575
Jab is fun, hook is good, but
the upper cut, just bring all

558
00:30:06.586 --> 00:30:09.849
your energy together, and one
boom, that's it, done.

559
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.175
The jab punch is kind of like a
surprising punch, though, right?

560
00:30:13.198 --> 00:30:15.449
So you can snap it real quick,

561
00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:18.909
catch them.

562
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.803
And you don't have to use too
much energy either.

563
00:30:21.922 --> 00:30:22.589
Yeah.

564
00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.869
All right, everybody, if you've
got a favorite punch out there,

565
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.619
let us know in the chat.

566
00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.775
All right, here we go.

567
00:30:35.798 --> 00:30:37.215
So let's get back into it.

568
00:30:37.238 --> 00:30:40.171
We're going to do round number
two now, and as I said, we're

569
00:30:40.182 --> 00:30:43.247
going to add in some defense to
go along with the moves that we

570
00:30:43.258 --> 00:30:44.275
already worked on.

571
00:30:44.378 --> 00:30:45.411
So let's get to it.

572
00:30:45.466 --> 00:30:47.829
First things first, we're going
to get into our boxing stance,

573
00:30:47.829 --> 00:30:50.470
get those hands up, get that
bounce going.

574
00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.591
All right, our first defensive
move, we're going to start off

575
00:30:56.602 --> 00:30:57.843
with the shoulder roll.

576
00:30:57.892 --> 00:31:02.033
So for the shoulder roll, we're
just leaning side to side,

577
00:31:02.033 --> 00:31:04.184
rolling those shoulders left to
right.

578
00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.075
Just imagine there's a punch
coming towards your face and

579
00:31:07.086 --> 00:31:10.471
you've got to avoid that punch,
so roll your shoulders as quick

580
00:31:10.482 --> 00:31:13.199
as you can so you don't get hit.

581
00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.909
Let's go.

582
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.429
There's Avery doing a great job

583
00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.799
with the quick side to side
movement, avoiding those punches.

584
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.155
Good work, everybody.

585
00:31:32.278 --> 00:31:33.987
So we practiced left to right.

586
00:31:34.074 --> 00:31:36.389
Let's do the same thing right
to left.

587
00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.447
Awesome, Marcela.

588
00:31:38.544 --> 00:31:40.339
Way to add in the footwork.

589
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.810
All right, everybody, we're
going to keep those shoulder

590
00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:52.227
rolls going, but we're going to
add two jabs and then shoulder

591
00:31:52.228 --> 00:31:52.656
rolls.

592
00:31:52.688 --> 00:31:55.727
So we're going left, right jab,
following it up with the

593
00:31:55.738 --> 00:31:57.139
shoulder rolls.

594
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.149
Good work, everybody.

595
00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.889
Jab, jab, shoulder roll.

596
00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.675
As Avery mentioned earlier,
after you finish your

597
00:32:11.686 --> 00:32:13.729
combination, make sure you reset.

598
00:32:13.814 --> 00:32:15.327
Get those hands back up.

599
00:32:15.414 --> 00:32:17.567
Cover your face and your body.

600
00:32:17.654 --> 00:32:18.959
Stay protected.

601
00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.711
Awesome work, Avery.

602
00:32:21.766 --> 00:32:23.279
Good job, Marcela.

603
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.559
All right, we're going to take
it a step further, everybody.

604
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:28.015
We're going to add in another
punch.

605
00:32:28.048 --> 00:32:30.927
So we're still keeping our jab,
jab, shoulder roll, but we're

606
00:32:30.938 --> 00:32:33.171
going to add in two hooks at
the end.

607
00:32:33.226 --> 00:32:36.819
So jab, jab, shoulder roll,
shoulder roll, hook, hook.

608
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:38.969
Let's go.

609
00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.559
Awesome work, Marcela.

610
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.223
Nice job with those.

611
00:32:45.262 --> 00:32:46.359
Quick punches.

612
00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:48.619
Quick shoulder rolls.

613
00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.675
Awesome, everybody.

614
00:32:53.778 --> 00:32:54.909
We got 10,

615
00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.029
9,

616
00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.149
GREAT!

617
00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.229
7,

618
00:32:58.530 --> 00:32:59.459
6,

619
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:00.499
5----------

620
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:01.729
4,

621
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:02.749
3,

622
00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:03.979
2,

623
00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.079
and SPIRIT.

624
00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.855
Way to go, everybody.

625
00:33:07.958 --> 00:33:08.849
Good job.

626
00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:10.507
All right, Avery's

627
00:33:10.524 --> 00:33:12.849
going to show us our next move.

628
00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.563
All right, Kristian, our next
defensive move that we're going

629
00:33:15.574 --> 00:33:17.663
to practice here today is going
to be the duck.

630
00:33:17.792 --> 00:33:18.115
All right?

631
00:33:18.138 --> 00:33:21.989
So if you're doing it seated
like myself, it's sort of like a

632
00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.631
seated crunch.

633
00:33:23.696 --> 00:33:25.283
So I'm just going to duck like
this.

634
00:33:25.322 --> 00:33:26.655
My hands are still going to be
up.

635
00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.269
My head is going to be up so I
can see.

636
00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.871
I'm going to duck like this.

637
00:33:30.926 --> 00:33:33.091
Okay, let's just practice.

638
00:33:33.236 --> 00:33:36.569
You can check out Marcela and
Kristian if you're standing to

639
00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:37.755
follow along with them.

640
00:33:37.778 --> 00:33:38.349
Okay?

641
00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.299
Great job, Marcela.

642
00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.191
Remember, when you're ducking,
you still want to keep your

643
00:33:49.202 --> 00:33:50.369
guard up.

644
00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.707
Sometimes when you duck, that's
when you get caught with that

645
00:33:55.718 --> 00:33:57.211
uppercut, Kristian.

646
00:33:57.356 --> 00:33:58.289
Oh, yeah.

647
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:01.009
Hands up, everybody.

648
00:34:03.719 --> 00:34:04.709
Great job.

649
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:11.036
All right, let's rock this out
for about another 20 seconds,

650
00:34:11.036 --> 00:34:13.219
and then we're going to add
some punches.

651
00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.319
Great work, everyone.

652
00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:22.329
Keep it up.

653
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.171
All right.

654
00:34:28.226 --> 00:34:28.923
10,

655
00:34:29.121 --> 00:34:29.869
9,

656
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.069
GREAT!

657
00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.169
7,

658
00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:33.218
6,

659
00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:34.549
5----------

660
00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:35.849
4,

661
00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:36.999
3,

662
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:38.249
2,

663
00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:39.959
and SPIRIT.

664
00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.138
All right, we're still going to
keep our guards up.

665
00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:43.959
We're still practicing our duck.

666
00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.246
Now, this time around, we're
going to duck, and then we're

667
00:34:46.257 --> 00:34:49.143
going to throw a right hook and
a left hook.

668
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:52.999
Okay, so we're going to duck,
right, left.

669
00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.649
Guard's up, duck, right, left.

670
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:59.759
Guard's up, duck, right, left.

671
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:05.429
Great job transitioning,
everyone.

672
00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.179
Good work, Kristian.

673
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:21.369
Excellent.

674
00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.139
Great job, Marcela.

675
00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.399
All right, 20 seconds.

676
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.947
All right, let's finish it out
strong, everyone.

677
00:35:47.034 --> 00:35:47.669
10,

678
00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:48.949
9,

679
00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.149
GREAT!

680
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.489
7,

681
00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.649
6,

682
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:54.269
5----------

683
00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:55.829
4,

684
00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.359
3,

685
00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:58.889
2,

686
00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:00.595
and SPIRIT.

687
00:36:00.708 --> 00:36:04.115
All right, we're going to keep
that same process going, but

688
00:36:04.126 --> 00:36:05.575
this time we're going to

689
00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:10.649
duck, hook, hook, duck again,
right uppercut, left uppercut.

690
00:36:10.706 --> 00:36:12.859
Okay, so that's going to be a
duck,

691
00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.879
hook, hook, another duck,

692
00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.387
uppercut, upper cut.

693
00:36:17.474 --> 00:36:18.109
Okay?

694
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.799
Duck, hook, hook, duck again,
uppercut, uppercut.

695
00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:24.239
Great.

696
00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:25.329
Just like that.

697
00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.399
30 seconds.

698
00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.589
Let's knock it out.

699
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.299
Literally.

700
00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.219
Great work, Kristian.

701
00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.119
Great job, Marcela.

702
00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.319
All right, 15 seconds.

703
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.091
All right.

704
00:37:06.146 --> 00:37:06.843
10,

705
00:37:07.042 --> 00:37:07.789
9,

706
00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:08.989
GREAT!

707
00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:10.379
7,

708
00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:11.319
6,

709
00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.629
5----------

710
00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:13.999
4,

711
00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.309
3,

712
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:16.969
2,

713
00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:18.959
and SPIRIT.

714
00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.087
Great work, everyone.

715
00:37:21.174 --> 00:37:22.143
Great work.

716
00:37:22.342 --> 00:37:24.849
All right, Marcela, what do you
have for us next?

717
00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.419
All right, our next defense
move is going to be the block.

718
00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:32.590
So for this one, try to bring
those elbows together right in

719
00:37:32.602 --> 00:37:34.629
front of our face to protect.

720
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.383
So we're going to start first
with our blocks.

721
00:37:38.512 --> 00:37:40.099
Side to side blocks.

722
00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:43.619
Again.

723
00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:44.869
Just like that.

724
00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.709
Very good.

725
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:59.799
Good job, Kristian.

726
00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.619
Nice, Avery.

727
00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.903
We're going to keep going with
this block, and we're going to

728
00:38:19.914 --> 00:38:22.419
add some punches to the block.

729
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.939
Let's do that for another 10
seconds,

730
00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.339
9,

731
00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:28.709
GREAT!

732
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.919
7,

733
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:31.259
6,

734
00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:32.429
5----------

735
00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:33.689
4,

736
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.909
3,

737
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.259
2,

738
00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.359
and SPIRIT.

739
00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:40.507
Good job, everyone, keep moving.

740
00:38:40.674 --> 00:38:42.555
Time for our uppercuts.

741
00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:46.239
So we're going to do a block,
uppercut, uppercut.

742
00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.549
Block, uppercut, uppercut.

743
00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.239
Nice.

744
00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.709
Block, uppercut, uppercut.

745
00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:01.079
Excellent.

746
00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:09.839
Block,

747
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.919
and uppercuts.

748
00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:13.719
Looking good, Avery.

749
00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.629
Good job.

750
00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:22.879
Nice, Kristian.

751
00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.009
Good job, Marcela.

752
00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.309
Get ready to add another punch.

753
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.759
So we're going to do

754
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.819
block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

755
00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:41.469
Block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

756
00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:45.739
Block, uppercut, uppercut,
block, jab, jab.

757
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.899
There we go.

758
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:55.899
A lot to think in here.

759
00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:59.049
Nice work.

760
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.209
Good job, Kristian.

761
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.829
Nice, keep it up, keep it up,
almost there.

762
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.179
10,

763
00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:16.789
9,

764
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:18.299
GREAT!

765
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.589
7,

766
00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:20.789
6,

767
00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:22.099
5----------

768
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:23.819
4,

769
00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:25.099
3,

770
00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.379
SPIRIT.

771
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:32.199
Awesome.

772
00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:33.919
All right.

773
00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:36.011
Way to go, Marcela.

774
00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.689
Way to go, Avery.

775
00:40:38.908 --> 00:40:41.151
That was a real workout,
everybody.

776
00:40:41.286 --> 00:40:42.483
Good job.

777
00:40:42.522 --> 00:40:44.869
Let's go get another quick sip
of water.

778
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.587
All right, congratulations,
everybody.

779
00:40:53.674 --> 00:40:57.375
We made it to the finish line,
and we did it with style.

780
00:40:57.488 --> 00:40:59.735
You all did an amazing job
today.

781
00:40:59.918 --> 00:41:02.146
So what we're going to do next,
we're going to finish it off

782
00:41:02.158 --> 00:41:05.186
with some cool down stretches
so we can relax all those

783
00:41:05.198 --> 00:41:07.879
muscles that we fired up today.

784
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:10.983
Our first stretch, we're going
to start off with the side bend.

785
00:41:11.032 --> 00:41:12.103
We're going to get our core.

786
00:41:12.152 --> 00:41:14.279
We did a lot of twisting and
turning.

787
00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.469
We're going to

788
00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:21.125
help those muscles relax by
bringing one arm up and over

789
00:41:21.125 --> 00:41:23.250
and leaning to the opposite side.

790
00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:26.399
We'll hold it for 10 seconds

791
00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.619
and then switch.

792
00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.467
3,

793
00:41:34.634 --> 00:41:35.395
2,

794
00:41:35.578 --> 00:41:37.443
and switch it up.

795
00:41:37.562 --> 00:41:39.509
Same thing on the other side.

796
00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.409
5----------

797
00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:52.409
4,

798
00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.249
3,

799
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:54.079
2,

800
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:55.003
and SPIRIT.

801
00:41:55.072 --> 00:41:55.543
Good job.

802
00:41:55.582 --> 00:41:57.282
Now we're going to take both
hands and we're going to reach

803
00:41:57.294 --> 00:42:00.551
them down towards the floor,
and we're going to hold it.

804
00:42:00.606 --> 00:42:03.670
If you're standing up, try to
keep those legs nice and

805
00:42:03.682 --> 00:42:04.619
straight.

806
00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.139
Reach down towards the floor.

807
00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:18.829
5----------

808
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.739
4,

809
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:20.659
3,

810
00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:21.599
2,

811
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:22.523
and SPIRIT.

812
00:42:22.572 --> 00:42:23.119
Good job.

813
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:24.079
Last one, everybody.

814
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:26.993
We're going to reach in the
opposite direction now, hands

815
00:42:26.993 --> 00:42:28.292
up above our head.

816
00:42:28.346 --> 00:42:31.155
Get those shoulders and arms
stretched out.

817
00:42:31.178 --> 00:42:33.316
If you want to get your lower
back in the mix, you could push

818
00:42:33.328 --> 00:42:35.369
your hips forward and lean back.

819
00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:41.943
And we'll hold it for 10,

820
00:42:42.142 --> 00:42:42.983
9,

821
00:42:43.182 --> 00:42:43.975
GREAT!

822
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:44.929
7,

823
00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:45.879
6,

824
00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:46.759
5----------

825
00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.769
4,

826
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:48.649
3,

827
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:49.539
2,

828
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.519
and SPIRIT.

829
00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:53.549
Awesome job today, everybody.

830
00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.527
Great work, Avery.

Great work, Marcella.

836
00:43:04.648 --> 00:43:07.949
Great work, Kristian, awesome
class, love the energy.

837
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:13.711
Lots of fun as always,
everybody, thank you all again

838
00:43:13.722 --> 00:43:15.971

with us.
